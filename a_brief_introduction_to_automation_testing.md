# A brief introduction to Automation Testing
## What is Automation Testing?

In software development, software testing is the process of detecting errors and ensuring design requirements are met. There are two methods to achieve this: manual and automated.

Automation testing is the conduct of software testing using automated tools. The method reduces manual work of professional testers and provides efficiency in terms of immediate feedback, test report generation, test reusability, enhanced accuracy, etc..

## Types of automated tests
Depending on the nature of a project, testers can deploy a combination of both manual and automated tests. Here are some common types of automated tests:
- **Regression testing**: In most programs, some features can depend on other features, and errors often occur when new code is introduced. The type of test exposing such complication is called a regression test; software testers often automate these tests to accurately cover all errors.
- **Unit testing**: It is a common practice for programmers to modularize a program into small components responsible for different functionalities. Unit tests help isolate issues arising from these components and avoid complications when assembling them. And as a program becomes more complex, there are more units to test, which requires automated unit testing.
- **Integration testing**: Software integration happens when software units are combined. The process can trigger errors due to unexpected incompatibility of the units. Integration testing exposes such errors by combining the components as groups and monitoring their behaviors. In this phase, automation tools assist testers with complex test case generation and test report management.
## Challenges of automation testing

The ease of automation comes with its own disadvantages.  Automated testing frameworks require specific knowledge and coding skills. Testers manage automation in form of scripts, which means more work on script maintenance and update. Also, they must ensure that the testing framework in use is compatible with the target program and the types of test being executed.
